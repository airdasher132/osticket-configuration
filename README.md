First I checked the installed osTicket settings and changed to proper time zones and names for useability and accessibility through a link. Also a site available for users to create tickets and directly submit them to the proper department.

I made sure different departments had seperate permissions. As well as certain ones being able to change/modify tickets when necessary.

Made 3 different type of SLA plans. Sev-A, Sev-B and Sev-C. So tickets will be distrubuited based on priority and urgency needed.
